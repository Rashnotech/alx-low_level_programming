# BIT MANIPULATION
This project deals with using binary digit to perform computational operation
which include the List of task accordinly:
# Task
<ol>
<li> Binary to Unsigned Int: This task is to convert binary to integer using bit manipulation </li>
<p>I checked the length of the binary number supplied then, loop through the number check if it's a digit </p>
</ol>
