# Dynamic Libraries
Dynamic Libraries also know as share library. A shared libraries overcome the bottleenecks encountered in static libraries in which the archive file containing the object code is linked to the executable file. However in a situation where the object file are recompiled due to updates or change in the library the system administrator have to keep track of the executable files that use the static libraries.
A share library overcome this challenge instead of linking a single copy of the library is loaded into memory at run time, when the first program requiring module from share library is started. When other programs using the same shared libary are later executed, they use the copy of the library that is already loaded into memory. Each process that uses the library has its own copies of the global and static variable that are define within the library.
